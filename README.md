## Creating use cases and domain model
For "Little animal horror zoo".


## Programming exercise
1. Create a class named Person. Attributes: name and age

2. Create a constructor that takes two parameters. Name and age. Set the attributes to the values 
sent into the constructor.

3. Add another constructor so a person-object can be created without specifying name and age.

4. Crate a class named LivingRoom with a name and a numberOfPeople (in the room).
- numberOfPeople should have the value 0 (since there are no people in the living room when it is created).

5. Define a constructor so that it is impossible to make a livingroom-object without specifying a name.

6. Add an attribute to the LivingRoom class, called personsNameInChair, to hold the name of a person (sitting in the chair).

7. Add another 2 attributes called, personsNameInCouchPosition1 and personsNameInCouchPosition2, to hold the name of a person sitting in the couch.

8. Create set methods for the attributes. The methods should take a parameter to pass the persons name.

9. Define a class, called RunLivingRoom and in the main-method, create 3 people (give each person object a name and an age). 

10. Create a livingroom object.

11. use the setPersonInChair method by passing the persons name as a parameter.

12. Create a method in the living room class, that prints out the numberOfPeople using System.out.println. Call it printNumberOfPeople.

13. Call the setPersonInCouchPosition1 method, passing a persons name.

14. Call the setPersonInCouchPosition1 method, passing a persons name.

15. Call the printNumberOfPeople people again. Do you have 3 people in the living room?

16. What happens if you call the setPersonInCouchPosition2 again with another person? Who sits in the couch, then?

17. print out the result of the getNumberOfPeople method call again. Do you have 3 people in the living room?
